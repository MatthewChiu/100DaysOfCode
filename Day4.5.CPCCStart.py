# Presented at the Future Directions of Music Cognition with Noah (Kahrs): Chord Spacing and Quality. 
# We didn't receive many questions, but the slack channel was popping and there were a bunch of awesome talks (open access!).

# In addition to a bit more solo coding exercises, I edited a bit of my website and started construction on the website for the CPCC (see its github page).
# So today was mostly HTML (and a little bit of CSS), but no JS.
