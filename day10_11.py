# Sooooo technically there were a few days that went by where I was coding/learning through codeacademy, but not doing much other than that. 
# We visited Eron's family in GA, so I didn't have that much time... but we had great family time!

# Over the past days, I worked more on react and did a bunch of things for the catFoodCounter:
# Counter active; at the end of a day, subtract 4 cans; add 24,32,40 cans or 1 up/down at a time.
